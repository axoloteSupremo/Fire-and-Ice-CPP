/**************************************************************************************
 This is the poem I'm trying to print out: 
 Some say the world will end in fire
 Some say in ice. 
 From what I've tasted of desire
 I hold with those who favor fire.
 But if it had to perish twice,
 I think I know enough of hate
 To say that for destruction ice
 Is also great
 And would suffice.
